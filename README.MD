Our Daily Blog

## Description

I wanted to make the basic structure for a shared blog page where multiple users could add their daily stories. I was motivated to capture the daily goings on of others by my nautural intrest in the unique lives of others. I hope to one day improve the site by adding more engaging cosmetic elements and polishing the overall look of the site. 


## Usage

The user need only fill in the title and author boxes with their respective information, write a blog post, and click the log button.
Here is a Link to the deployed site https://hevidevi.github.io/DailyBlog/
